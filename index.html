    <p> Hi! I’m Sa'Niya Whitfield, a junior at Energy Institute High School, where I explore the world through a mix of music, engineering, mechanics, writing, and sports. From a young age, I’ve been driven by a curiosity to create, problem-solve, and bring ideas to life—whether that’s through crafting a new piece of music, fixing a machine, or writing something that sparks emotion. One of the things that excites me the most is taking an idea, something that’s just a thought or a dream, and transforming it into something real. It’s this process of creation and innovation that pushes me to develop my leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills. Whether I’m working alone or with a team, I thrive on turning possibilities into reality. A key turning point for me came when I enrolled in a creative writing class. I was pushed out of my comfort zone, especially when it came to improv performances, an experience that tested my confidence in front of an audience. But through that discomfort, I discovered a new way to express myself and began to overcome my anxiety about performing. That journey not only deepened my appreciation for creative writing but also sparked a passion for building and crafting things in ways I hadn’t considered before. Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue honing my skills, exploring new interests, and maybe one day sharing my creations with the world. Whether through writing, engineering, or whatever else the future holds, I’m ready to take on new challenges and see where my passions take me.</p>
